## Development Requiements:

[ A simple getting started guide](https://nikolak.com/pyqt-qt-designer-getting-started/)


1. PyQt4
2. Qt Designer 4.8.7 ( requred to edit .ui file)

1. point the "ip"  and "apiKey" to where Octoprint is living. Point it to the local host in case it is running on the same system
2. in case of running it on anything other than a raspberry pi, disable the raspberry pi option

..* git clone into root directory of Raspberry Pi https://github.com/FracktalWorks/Julia2018Octoprint.git
